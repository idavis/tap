# Code Samples

Chapters contain sections, which is where the bulk of your content should be.  A section contains text, and can include images and code samples.

This section will show how a code sample works.  Here is a code sample:

<<(code/sample1.rb)

Here is another sample:

<<[This Code Sample Has A Title](code/sample2.rb)

This text is after the code sample.
